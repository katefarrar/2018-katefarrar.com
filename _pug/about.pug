    h1.title About Me

    section.center

      p <strong>Hi <img src="/assets/images/emoji-wave.png" width="25px" style="position:relative; top: 2px"> I'm Kate! </strong><br>I'm a designer and developer living in beautiful Denver, Colorado. I'm passionate about designing for humans, strategic design thinking, and collaboration.
      
      p <strong>Here are some silly things you should know about me:</strong><br> I gasp aloud every time I see a dog. At any given moment, I am reading 3 to 5 books. Tangerine is my favorite flavor of La Croix. According to science (a Buzzfeed quiz) I am 60% Leslie Knope and 40% Liz Lemon. My all time favorite TV show is The West Wing. My bathrobe doubles as a Jedi robe.
